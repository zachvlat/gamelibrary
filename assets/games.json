    "Description": "Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have grown as a couple since 2010. It seems like only yesterday the two love birds were escaping from an exploding laboratory in the sky. Now it’s the current year, and they’ve welcomed their daughter Nugget into the world. Their peaceful days enjoying life as a family came to an abrupt end when Dr. Fetus beat the snot out of them with a rusty shovel, and kidnapped Nugget! Now it’s up to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl to rescue their daughter from a lunatic fetus in a jar that can only be described as an incel version of Tony Stark.\n<br>\n<br>- Super Meat Boy Forever is the sequel to Super Meat Boy! This is a new experience that eclipses the original. Don’t stare directly at it unless you still have your eclipse glasses.\n<br>- 7200 individually handcrafted levels combine dynamically to give you a new challenge every single time you play. Seven thousand two hundred levels. They said we couldn’t do it, but we did. Who’s they? Don’t ask. They don’t like it when you ask.\n<br>- It’s hard, but fair. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. Just ask Dark Soulman.\n<br>- Meat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.\n<br>- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.\n<br>- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)\n<br>- A soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness.\n<br>- Frame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions.\n<br>- A story so rich and moving that it makes Citizen Kane look like an unboxing video for a dehumidifier.",

Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.\n<br>\n<br>With the Shadowrun Returns Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns with the Steam Workshop community. You can even explore the entire Shadowrun Returns Seattle campaign in the Editor directly – see how it was built and borrow as much as you need to jump-start your own creations!

The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.\n<br>\n<br>The main character Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.\n<br>\n<br>Abe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.",

The mysterious Eldar are all that remains of a once great and powerful civilization that ruled the galaxy. They travel the stars in enormous spacecraft called Craftworlds, seeking the Maiden Worlds their ancestors created in ancient times.\n<br><br>\nOne such world is now inhabited by humans and possesses historical records and artifacts of great power far too valuable to leave in their hands. This once proud race now fights for its very survival, and must protect the secrets and power of their ancestors from both the Imperium of Man and the evil, bio-engineered Tyranids, bent on the destruction of this fertile paradise.\n<br><br>\nRites of War features a tightly crafted storyline composed of 24 missions and varied victory conditions as you lead the Eldar in their fight for survival. Additional scenarios allow for control of Tyrannid and Imperial armies and a glory point system lets you build and customize your own army, with 8 distinct troop classes ranging from War Machines to Assault Troops to Devastator Squads. A level-based experience system enhances the game's RPG (Role-Playing Game) element, allowing you to upgrade and customize units, enhance warrior skills and employ \"psyker\" (psychic) abilities.",

    "Description": "When Lara was only 16, she was tutored in archaeology by Professor Werner Von Croy, a world-famous archaeologist. Skip forward now, to find Lara in Egypt, minding her own business until a pool of quicksand pulls her underground, deep into an ancient tomb. Here she unwittingly releases the evil god Set, and for the rest of the game her ultimate aim is to recapture him and return him to his prison. Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation follows her quest through 43 levels, all set in the same underground world, so the story moves as seamlessly and effortlessly as the famous Tomb Raider herself.\n<br><br>\nIn Tomb Raider Chronicles, Lara is still missing in Egypt and there is no word about her whereabouts. Fearing the worst, her closest friends arrange a service in her honor and to share their insights about some of Lara’s more mysterious exploits. Tomb Raider Chronicles offers new insights into the past adventures of Lara Croft along with a host of new weapons such as the grappling hook gun and a sniper rifle. If you feel creative and want to make your own adventures, the official Tomb Raider Level Editor is included with the game.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://items.gog.com/tr45_ratings.png\">",

Having eaten five Astropaths en-route to their new stations, Ork Warboss Skroll of the Evil Sunz clan is visited with (demented?) dreams of grandeur and conquest and launches a full-scale WAAAGH! on the Imperial colony of Volistad. With the might of the Bad Moons, the rapacious Evil Sunz and the Orkiest of all clans, the Goffs, at his disposal, Skroll quickly swept aside the defences of Volistad and took control of the planet. Leading an army of Ultramarines and Imperial guard, you must retake the system and cleanse it of the foul alien by completing missions and annihilating the Ork forces. Though the Emperor protects you, you must remain vigilant, for like all Orks, Skroll loves fitin’, so he and his forces will take you to the last man and space marine. Only supreme tactics and precise execution will allow you to reclaim Volistad in the name of the Emperor.\n<br><br>\nSSI, the masterminds behind the Five Star General Series’, bring their Midas touch to the Warhammer 40,000 world in the first ever video-game adaption of the EPIC table-top game. With over 85 unit types, this addition to the 40k franchise brings the vastness and depth of an EPIC-style battle to your PC, allowing you greater selection and customisation over your army. This, along with the multiple scenarios and battlefronts to fight from, will keep your strategic mind on edge for hours on end.",

    "Name": "Age of Wonders III",
    "Description": "Age of Wonders III, like the previous games in the series is a turn-based strategy game set within a high fantasy universe where the player assumes the role of a political-military leader. Gameplay is 4X-based (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate) where players explore the world map, slowly building an empire through colonization, warfare and diplomacy with rival powers. However new to III is the greater addition of role-playing game features, where players must first choose and customize their leader, all options dependant on the player's chosen style of play. There are six available races in the initial release: humans, draconians, high elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins, all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities. The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select. Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race, each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy, both in combat and when managing their empire. On release there are six different classes a leader can be. The \"Sorcerer\" class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units. The \"Theocrat\" derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors. The \"Rogue\" favors less direct approaches to situations, employing stealth, thievery and manipulation aswell as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare. The \"Archdruid\" channels the power of nature, using it to their advantage by being very self-sufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures. The \"Dreadnaught\" leads a steampunk styled society, using large industry, machinery and gunpowder-based units like cannons and tanks. Finally the \"Warlord\" specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics, utilizing effective non-magic based units and abilities.\n<br>Leaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up, while also being able to gain new equipment and powers. Players can also develop their alignment between good and evil based on their player's actions and the cultures the player absorbs into their empire, rather than race like the previous games in the series.\n<br>Cities themselves provide much of the resources, infrastructure and host to unit recruitment. Independent cities and units not immediately aligned to any player/leader are also present in the world map. Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a city's domain, and they won't forget that they're tied to it. Many of these independent settlements aren't cities in the traditional sense, but can be alternative settlements, like a \"Giant's Keep\" for example. The player can conquer these holdings, which will provide units like a city, or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute and diplomatic and/or alignment standing. Quests can also be given to players by independent forces and cities, including but not limited to clearing out wild units, searching for relics and even conquering cities and other holdings. Quests can grant the support of independent forces for player in addition to a reward such as gold or equipment, sometimes with the choice of either given to the player upon completion of the quest.\n<br>As in the case of the first game in the series, Age of Wonders III offers a story-driven campaign that is playable from two sides, the human-centric Commonwealth Empire and the Court of the High Elves. In addition to the campaign; single-player scenarios, online multiplayer, random map generation and a map editor are also available. The graphics of Age of Wonders III will be presented in 3D instead of the isometric view the series has utilized up to this point.",

Using dimmed and pastel colors throughout the scenery creates a sense of remoteness from reality and builds an unreal atmosphere of the landscape.",

    "Description": "The year is 1988. Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation. While she’s home, she’s making some extra money as a photographer for the Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThimbleweed Park hasn’t changed at all in the year since Delores has been away… or has it? \n<br>\n\n<br>\n…Since when is the S&D Diner a five-star establishment?\n<br>\n…When did the PillowBear™ become all the rage?\n<br>\n…Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards? \n<br>\n…How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the bridge a year ago?\n<br>\n…Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nIn a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least of your problems...\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure</b> started out as a prototype for Ron Gilbert’s new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThis was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively “found art” from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we couldn’t go outside IRL.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nAs a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can have fun with in these odd times. You don’t have to have played Thimbleweed Park to enjoy this mini-adventure. (But if you do enjoy it, why not check out <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/game/thimbleweed_park\">Thimbleweed Park</a>, hmm?)",

The story takes place in an unknown space and time. In this galaxy mythical floating islands give shelter to all kinds of unusual and dangerous creatures. The game combines elements of fantasy and sci-fi genres.<br><br> <br><br> Build interesting structures, plant vegetation, breed animals, take care of your minions, use divine PSI powers, triumph in face of natural disasters, fight monsters, predict the future, reveal secrets and much more. Assume the lead over Mims as they journey across the galaxy in their epic quest!<br><br> <br><br> During their intergalactic voyage Mims are hit by an asteroid - their spaceship reduced to debris and the crew forced to evacuate onto nearby planets, which hold their own share of surprises.<br><br> <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/337820/extras/eascreen(18)_wynik.jpg?t=1622204399\"><br><br> <br><br> The player's goal, among others, is to perform various tasks necessary to repair the spaceship. You begin by properly expanding your new colonies. Every mission takes place on a different planet, where isolated groups of castaways face their own fate.<br><br> <br><br> The game combines numerous elements of gameplay: Your colonists act on their own most of the time, going about their duties without orders issued by the player. However, you can control them directly by issuing simple commands.<br><br> <br><br> As the leader of the colony you have psionic power at your disposal, altering the fauna and flora of your planet, as well as the environment which they inhabit.<br><br> The main focus of the game lies in expanding and defending the colony. Every building or plant placement counts, nevertheless the game falls more into a light-strategy genre.<br><br> <br><br> The basic resource crucial to the colony's survival and development is energy. It is also essential to Mims’ vitality - used while performing work, as well as for maintaining proper functioning of the infrastructure. Vitality is obtained in generators using Bio Mass - derived, in turn, from special fruits processed in the Extractor. Part of the energy can also be obtained from wind flow thanks to correct placement of Wind Turbines.<br><br> <br><br> The tasks performed by the Mims should include the expansion of the colony and picking up Bio fruits.Some of the Mims act as a protection against various and dangerous creatures attracted by the scent of fruit and animals.<br><br> <br><br> The Mims’ knowledge allows them to breed animals that feed on different types of fruit. Grown animals can be traded with native tribes and exchanged for crystals essential in further expansion of the colony.<br><br> <br><br> In order to grow fruit for animals, Mims will also need to sow seeds from various plant species, such as exploding plant that hurls fruits around. Choosing good sites for sowing seeds has a strategic element to it.<br><br> <br><br> A clever leader is able to use the topography of the map to their advantage, thereby avoiding excessive scattering of fruit all over the planet. In case of a bad placement, fruit crop can be lost due to fruit rolling off the edge of the planet.<br><br> <br><br> If the crops fail to be harvested on time, they will soon rot away, resulting in a loss of a precious resource.<br><br> <br><br> Along the way you shall also gain access to new buildings, plants, acquire new Psi powers, as well as invent new skills for your Mims.<br><br> <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/337820/extras/eascreen(8)_wynik.jpg?t=1622204399\"><br><br> <br><br> Badly governed colony expansion may result in a crisis and chaos on your planet, in which case you might be forced to restart the scenario.<br><br> <br><br> As the story progresses, Mims will find themselves facing threats from outer space. One of them is a meteor storm that can wreak havoc among your colonists. In order to be prepared, you can invent technology that allows you to predict such future events.<br><br> <br><br> Help Mims survive the numerous perils of the galaxy in their bid to reach their final destination!<br><br> <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/337820/extras/ekstaktor.png?t=1622204399\"><br><h2>PREVIEWS</h2><br> Video game news outlets had this to say on 2 years old beta demo - bear in mind that the game underwent dramatic development since then:<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <em>\"The gameplay so far feels pretty solid, and is very much in line with what you’d expect from a city builder.The Mims Beginning is on Greenlight and could use some love.

    "Description": "<p>Description:</p>\n<p>Everybody Got Mad is a competitive (local) two player game which also features a single player bot training stage.  This project began in november as a conversation over too much caffeine at a local cafe.  </p>\n<p>While showing a few friends how I develop games, I decided to include them into the process and together we developed this frantic surreal little thing you see now before you.  <br></p>\n<p>We had non-artists create concept art.  Non level-designers design levels, and non-musicians come up with melodies.  It was then my job to try and sharpen up all of our accumulated ideas into a comprehensive game before new years eve.</p>\n<p>We liked the idea of giving the audience a lot of goodies even though the game itself isn't a very complex one, so the zip contains Everybody Got Mad the video game, along with concept art, doodles, character bio images, the poster graphic, the story and the theme song in mp3 format.</p>\n<p>OKAY SO HERES WHAT HAPPENED</p>\n<p>DADDY DAFFODIL RIGHT?! HE WAS HAVING THIS BIG BARBEQUE WITH HIS SON N WIFE N HE GOT SOME STEAKS YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS DOWN AT CHONCEYS FOR 4.99 RIGHT? YEAH! THOSE!

You will take the role of a Vault-dweller, a person who has grown up in a secluded, underground survival Vault.

A world of mutants, radiation, gangs and violence.\n<br><br>\nYour immediate task is to find a replacement for the broken water purification controller chip. Without that chip, your fellow Vault dwellers are doomed to dehydration or will be forced to leave the safety of the Vault for the Outside.\n<br><br>\nThe core of the game revolves around your character. Fallout uses a skill-based system to allow you to fine tune your character. As you gain experience (roughly half from combat, the other half from solving adventure seeds and non-combat events), your character will grow as you determine. Combat in Fallout is tactical turn-based. You can take as much time as you need to make decisions. Choose from different types of attacks, with a variety of weapons and attack skills.",

You are elite US sniper Karl Fairburne.

You must aid key scientists keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the Russians.\n<br>\n<br>Take advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill, patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race against time. Watch as the celebrated ‘bullet cam’ from Sniper Elite returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever – skilful shots are rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are graphically rendered in X-Ray as the bullet enters and destroys your victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life.\n<br>\n<br>As World War Two ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts. Use it wisely.",

A few more with new mechanics have been added to this version, which now has 70 levels. It's a short trip, but it doesn't end when you find the Heart. Completing the game will unlock another salvaged bullet hell game and 3 alternate protagonists for the main game with different gimmicks each.</p>",

    "Description": "In Andergast, whose inhabitants are considered to be notoriously superstitious, King Efferdan awaits a state visit from high-ranking dignitaries. For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares. As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved. Following an audience with the king, the prestigious task is assigned to him. However, not only does his task prove unexpectedly difficult, but it also turns out to be the first step of the greatest adventure of his life, which will lead him to the borders of the charted lands of Aventuria and beyond.\n<br><br>\nWith a history of more than 25 years, The Dark Eye is one of Europe's best-known role-playing brands. In addition to the popular pen & paper adventures, TDE has also inspired a series of successful computer games. The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav takes you deep into the world of Aventuria, where you’ll take on the role of young Geron and get caught up in a mysterious plot that threatens to wipe out the kingdom of Andergast, a back-water realm in the northwest of Aventuria.\n<br><br>",

    "Name": "Lovecraft's Untold Stories",
    "Description": "Lovecraft’s Untold Stories is an action roguelite with RPG elements. You explore randomly generated levels based in H.P. Lovecraft stories, fighting cultists and all kinds of monsters from the Mythos, improving your weapons and gear, solving puzzles and challenges, and looking for clues and knowledge to defeat the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods.<h4><b>LIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT’S STORIES </b></h4>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/Hospital3_small.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nLovecraft’s Untold Stories is based on H.P. Lovecraft’s stories. You will experience first-hand the cosmic horror created by the genius of Providence. Every character will go through an investigation that will take them through different locations, from the creepy old Victorian mansion to the abandoned hospital where forbidden experiments take place or the jungle where lost tribes celebrate forgotten rituals, just to name a few. Levels are randomly generated: it will be a different experience every time you play. Also, they vary depending on the character you’re playing with. Look for items and clues to unlock secrets and new stories!<h4><b>5 CHARACTERS, 5 WAYS OF FIGHTING THE MYTHOS</b></h4>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-GHOUL.gif\">\n\n<br>\nYou can play as 5 different characters, each with a different playstyle and storyline. A private detective, a witch, a thief, a professor, and even a ghoul—each with different stats, weapons, and combat moves, creating five entirely different gameplay experiences. The Detective offers a balanced playstyle, with average Health and Stamina. The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melée damage, has a high Health and regenerates itself, but can’t use medkits at all.<h4><b>DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE GREAT OLD ONES</b></h4>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-WITCH.gif\">\n\n<br>\nThe truth of the dark horrors that inhabit the universe is unbearable for any human mind. In the end, you can’t win against the Old Ones. Madness or death await you. But maybe you can delay the inevitable… If you face the Great Old Ones without any knowledge about them, you will go mad just by looking at their hideous features. But spread across every level you will find special items with information about the Great Old Ones. The more you know about them, the stronger your mind shall become – but knowledge is not easy to find, and if you are not thorough in your investigation you might get to the end of a storyline without finding everything that is to know. You will have to play with all the characters if you want to find all the information about every Great Old One!<h4><b>MADNESS AWAITS </b></h4>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/lovecrafts_untold_stories/LUT-THIEF.gif\">\n\n<br>\nInsanity crawls behind every corner for those who face the Mythos. In your investigations, you will face different situations where you have to choose what to do – make the wrong decision and you will start losing your mind. In order to face the Great Old Ones, you need knowledge, and to find it you have to explore – but the more you explore the more events that shake your sanity you will find… Those who go mad under the influence of the Mythos take their own life to escape the eternal terror they are now looking at. Not all hope is lost, though – there are some ways to recover your sanity…<h4><b>KEY FEATURES</b></h4>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><b>Fight hundreds of different monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos</b> in this intense action roguelite \n<br>\n</li><li><b>Explore Lovecraft’s stories:</b> every character has a storyline that crosses randomly generated levels set in different locations from Lovecraft’s stories, such as the hospital, the jungle, or the port city just to name a few\n<br>\n</li><li><b>Face the Great Old Ones:</b> Great Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, Shub-Niggurath, and Azathoth await you in special levels\n<br>\n</li><li><b>Investigate thoroughly: </b>explore every corner to find secret levels and knowledge about the Great Old Ones\n<br>\n</li><li><b>Learn about the Mythos to fight them:</b> to have a chance at fighting the Great Old Ones you need to acquire knowledge about them, or their mere presence will drive you insane\n<br>\n</li><li><b>Madness awaits:</b> in the course of your adventures you will have to make some decisions, and taking the wrong ones will shake your sanity.

Your tribe needs help.\n<br><br>\nIf you are truly the Chosen One, then you alone are capable of claiming the heritage of the Vault Dweller, to take back your birthright. Among the many wonders described in hallowed yellow pages of the Vault Dweller's Survival Guide is the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.

The Vault Dweller's Survival Guide promises the redemption of the GECK to all Vault Dwellers.\n<br><br>\nYour tribe has survived over ten years of drought but now their reserves are at an end. You must find Vault 13 and claim the technology that your tribe needs to survive. If you fail in this quest - your tribe will surely die.

You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!\n<br>\n<br>The main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated.\n<br>\n<br>Another feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player.\n<br>\n<br>The main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes. But in the same time, to give them a lot of freedom in clearing up the level and deciding how their play through will look like.\"",

The game is a direct continuation and development of the first part. The sequel has become much larger, more serious, more interesting and has acquired many new mechanics that will help you survive or brighten up your leisure time in the game. You are free to engage in animal breeding, the production of alcohol for the manufacture of various drinks and Molotov cocktails, brewing, cooking, farming, building and strengthening your base (electricity will help you!) Or just collect food and go on a journey across a diverse world accompanied by the rain. Potions will help you grow faster and stronger, cooking will open up many satisfying dishes for you, and your own farm will supply you with all the resources you need.

    "Description": "Age of Empires Online is a multiplayer online real-time strategy game developed by Robot Entertainment and Gas Powered Games, which released on August 16, 2011. Based upon the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, it was originally developed by Robot Entertainment, but on February 24, 2011, Gas Powered Games, took over production. The game was published by Microsoft.\n<br>\n<br>The game was free-to-play—it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features.\n<br>\n<br>On March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money.\n<br>\n<br>As of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain.\n<br>\n<br>In 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed. It was finalized and released on March 14th, 2021",

It began as only harrowing rumors from abroad, but a foul blight has come and infected most of the crops throughout the Sagerovian countryside. Following its arrival, a plague struck down nearly everyone in its path, leaving the survivors to clean up the mess of their fallen society... With the armies off, fighting in the war against Stothlheim, Sagerov is left scarcely defended and outlying settlements are helpless, and prime targets for callous invaders... An old and all-but-forgotten foe, hailing from the eastern steppes, the Horde has set its sights on the lonely farms and plague-weakened villages, leaving nothing but smoke, bodies, and ash, in their wake... Among those villages, Ravlova, resting in the Strastobol region, is a small and insignificant farming community, where people work from dawn till dusk, just to earn even a meager living. Two in particular are a husband and wife, Kolyask and Ridina, who're local farmers with a family, but they're also part of their village's militia.

They are hardworking, but enjoy leisure time activities such as bowling, the disco, a trip to the pub and perpetuating the species. The Diggles dynasty has been chosen by Godfather Odin to rid the world of Fenris, the hound of hell.\n\n<h4>BUILD YOUR CLAN</h4>Odin made sure no Diggle is the same. Develop each of them with a varied set of skills and combat techniques so you can grow your clan. Give Diggles some free time, make sure they are fed and entertained and soon your tunnels will be full of angry babies. But don’t get too comfortable - there are other unique clans down there.\n\n<h4>DEVELOP YOUR COLONY</h4>Make sure your clan has everything it needs in your new colony. With over 50 production sites to master, you will be busy exploring the technology tree, crafting with 20 production tools, and gathering seven different resources.\n\n<h4>DWARVES WITH ATTITUDE</h4>Snarky Diggles always end up in some story. Watch for yourself - all quests are featuring hand-crafted cutscenes full of humor, dwarfy attitude, and their gnomish problems. There are many stories to be told in more than 40 quests. Digging into the mud was never this fun.\n\n<h4>IT'S BEEN ALMOST 20 YEARS. WILL IT RUN?</h4>We are happy to bring back to life the story of Diggles (or Wiggles, or Гномы - depending on localization that is closer to your gamer's heart). The game received its portion of technical care and now runs on modern operating systems without any extra shenanigans. The story, visuals, and gameplay are untouched - with all its charm and flaws. Enjoy playing the game on Windows 7 or later, without legacy DRM, no FPS lock, and with few extra DirectX11 settings.",

It is a smart way of letting the player to set the difficulty by him/herself: going for the extra solution is a way of asking for bigger challenges. And the extra levels are the biggest challenges you can face! There is a difference between understanding new mechanics and getting to their true core. Are you ready?</p><br> <br><h2>ALL HAIL THE PUZZLE LORD!</h2><br> <br><p>Maigo is an explorer who’s about to discover something far bigger than he expects.

    "Description": "In Smoke and Sacrifice players assume the role of Sachi, a young mother on a quest to discover the fate of her child. The game takes place in a darkly fantastical world where grotesque plant life and animals roam and harsh societal customs rule. Taking cues from modern survival classics, Smoke and Sacrifice evolves the genre with its intensely personal story and complex ecosystem. Creatures forage, mate, breed and prey on one another, creating a living world. Only by taming the game’s wilds can Sachi hope to unravel the mystery at the heart of Smoke and Sacrifice.\n<br>\n<br>Depicted in a beautiful, hand-painted style, Smoke and Sacrifice’s storybook visuals disguise its brutal story of motherhood and survival. Sachi doesn’t just have to worry about the game’s antagonists - the entire game world poses a threat. Players can alter the behaviour of plant and animal life, but this may also limit the resources Sachi has to craft items from. The deadly smoke also poses unique challenges throughout the game, altering enemy as well as player behaviour.",

    "Description": "This game was clearly made with passion. You can see the proof of this almost everywhere. The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

Sheriff Alex Truman has a peaceful life dealing with lost dogs, trivial disputes, and a few drunks here and there. He should be the happiest lawman in the world. But there's just one small part of him that longs for some excitement, for something that would break the monotony he doesn't even realise is eating him alive.<br><br><br><br>One cold November night it seems his unspoken wishes may have been granted when he’s involved in a car accident with a man who appears suddenly in the middle of the road. Alex is fine, but the man ends up in hospital with a broken leg, and several cracked ribs. Nobody knows who this guy is or where he has come from, and to make matters worse, he won’t speak. Finally the town has its first real mystery, and Alex is overjoyed. But that joy is to be short lived.<br><br><br><br>With no way of finding out the man’s identity, he’s moved to the local state mental health facility, and life in Deacon Oaks goes back to normal, until two months later when Alex gets a call informing him that the “road guy” has at last spoken. Three words were all he would say – “Cold Winter Farm, Cold Winter Farm, Cold Winter Farm”, over and over again.<br><br><br><br>Alex has no idea what it means, but he does know that Cold Winter Farm is on the edge of town, and that’s good enough. The mystery is back, and Alex wants to get to the bottom of it right away. Problem is, the biggest storm in fifty years is heading towards town – he’ll never make it out to the farm and back before the storm hits. But Alex doesn’t care – something deep inside is driving him – he has to know who the “road guy” is, and he has to know now. Abandoning all rational thought and ignoring the warnings of his deputy, he grabs the keys to the 4x4 and heads out.<br><br><br><br>Ten minutes after he arrives at the farm, the storm is so out of control, that it uproots a tree, which falls onto the house, crushing the roof, and trapping Alex in the basement. That’s not all though. The fallen tree has opened up a hidden doorway, which leads to a secret corridor. At the end of the corridor is an elevator, and the only place it can go is down. With no chance of being rescued until the next day, and with the overpowering need to find answers drowning out the fear he feels, Alex decides to take the elevator down.<br><br><br><br>But what will be waiting for him at the bottom? Will it explain the origins and identity of the “road guy”? Will it explain why the “road guy” was walking in the middle of the road, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the freezing winter? Will it explain why he wouldn’t speak for two months? And if it does, will the answers be simple, or will they be ultimately more disturbing and terrifying than anyone could imagine?</p><br>",

    "Description": "<p><strong>0 A.D.</strong> (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) is a free, open-source, historical Real Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire Games, a global group of volunteer game developers. As the leader of an ancient civilization, you must gather the resources you need to raise a military force and dominate your enemies.</p>\n<h2>History is Yours for the Taking</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lTjIT27.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>“0 A.D.” is a time period that never actually existed:</strong> In the usual calendar, one goes from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. and skips zero. This reflects the historical fiction in the game: Who would have won if all the factions were pitted against each other when each of them was at its prime?</p>\n<p>We intend to portray some of the major civilizations over the millennium of 500 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Hence the midpoint, zero.) That is an ambitious prospect, so in the first edition of 0 A.D. we focus on the last five centuries B.C. Perhaps in future expansion packs, more civilizations will be added, along with additional gameplay features.</p>\n<p>We put a strong emphasis on historical accuracy while developing 0 A.D. We plan all our units and all our buildings based on reconstructions of how the units and the buildings might have looked like in the ancient world. We even name them in the original languages, such as Greek and Latin. But it’s worth remembering that any game should be fun to play, so, in many cases, we preferred playability over historical accuracy.</p>\n<h2>0 A.D. is Free of Charge</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/p5rmAgC.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>0 A.D. is completely downloadable at no cost and always will be. No “freemium” model, no in-game advertising, no catch. This is our iron-clad guarantee.</p>\n<p>Although you might find some people selling copies of 0 A.D. on physical media, remember, you will always have the option to download 0 A.D. gratis on the internet, directly from the developers.</p>\n<h2>0 A.D. is Free as in “Freedom”</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/05PWAa5.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>0 A.D. is freely licensed software, because we believe everyone should have access to great games, and that everyone can learn from developing them. You can redistribute and modify the game as long as you abide by the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" referrerpolicy=\"origin\">GPL</a>.

In 2003 development moved to a standalone game with its own engine, Pyrogenesis. In 2009-2010, the game was released as free, open-source software and and much of the codebase was rewritten. <a href=\"https://play0ad.com/about/the-story-of-0-a-d/\" title=\"The Story of 0 A.D.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" referrerpolicy=\"origin\">Learn more about the story of 0 A.D. »</a></p>\n<p>Currently, 0 A.D. is still in alpha phase, which means an early experimental phase. It is playable, and you can already download and test the game, but some features are still missing. When will 0 A.D. be released? It is very hard to predict. Even after we are done implementing all the features, we will want to conduct extensive beta testing, which can take a while. Information about release dates will be released at the appropriate time.</p>",

Nine fighters had entered the tournament from within sight and that each of them had battled against one another from within a strong and relentless manner, but in the end, Sho Hayate had proven to be the strongest competitor and that he had won the tournament while defeating King Leo (and his fake impersonator King Lion) from within the finals of the tournament.\n<br>\n<br>To seek revenge against Hayate and those who caused his humiliating downfall, King Leo has organized a second version of the Battle of the Beast God tournament, but this time, there's a new rule. Teams of 2 people must work together from within this new tournament so that they can either ensure victory or face defeat. The competitors from last year's tournament have learned of King Leo's new tournament and that each of them have decided to join forces with each other on either friendly or temporary terms. With the exception of Carol Stanzack (who decides to skip the tournament to continue her gymnastics training) and Nicola Zaza (who's too busy in having to work on his latest scientific project), Hayate and the fighters from the previous tournament have returned for combat and that they're ready to face the latest challenge that's presented to them by King Leo.\n<br>\n<br>However, the previous fighters aren't the only ones from within this tournament, as two new challengers have entered into the fray and that they have their own reasons in battling from within King Leo's new competition. The gathered fighters must be ready and prepared to not only fight against each other and King Leo from within this tournament, but also, they must deal with a possible unknown threat that lies directly from within the shadows of this competition as well.",

    "Description": "Blazing Star is a scrolling shooter video game for the Neo Geo home game system. It is the sequel to the acclaimed Neo Geo shooter Pulstar, which was itself a close cousin to the R-Type franchise. A typically hefty Neo Geo ROM at 346 Mb, the game makes extensive use of pseudo-3D prerendered sprites, brief anime and CGI cutscenes (mostly during the intro sequence), and frequent Engrish voice samples and captions. While Blazing Star was superior in many respects to previous shooter games, some fans compare it unfavorably with Pulstar on the basis that Blazing Star was overly easy and there are those that prefer the simpler 2D sprite look over the prerendered sprites that came to dominate many of the more recent shoot-em-ups.",

Combined with modern features and favorites, this hybrid approach has been carefully calibrated to offer a unique and original experience of balance and flexibility, all while retaining the depth of a traditional RPG. The game features its own theme, lore, and storyline, and the player is placed at the center of it all. The systems in the game all coexist and collaborate to bring life and flavor to the game world. There are often many ways to complete an objective or to reach a goal. The equipment system is deep, and a handy prybar or a strong rope may become useful or even essential at times and could mean the difference between life and death. There is a lot of diversity between gear such as weapons and armor, and there are many different ways to build a character and shape them into a specific role, or even a jack-of-all-trades. Skills and talents also reflect this. The character creation system allows you to choose every aspect about your character. This includes gender, race, familial background, occupational background, traits, religion, alignment, appearance, skills, talents, and more. Create the fiercest slayer, the mightiest knight, the darkest occultist, the deadliest archer, the stealthiest assassin, or absolutely anything in between. The classless advancement system offers complete and total freedom without constraints. The game is intended to bridge the gap between traditional and modern styled RPGs.\"</em></p><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>If possible, please support the developer on&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/880130/Lawless_Lands/\" class=\"tcf-links-fc tcf-links-ft tcf-links-u\">Steam</a></strong>&nbsp;(by getting it there too or even wishlisting it)</p><br><br><p>You missed it?

Experience unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.\n<br>\n<br>As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.\n<br>\n<br>A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.\"\n<br>\n<br>The Complete Edition of the episodic game Song of Horror, original available as a bundle of the base game and it's season pass.\n<br>It has replaced the original Song of Horror page, episode 1, on steam.\n<br>A bundle is available, discounted based on episodes already owned, for returning players to upgrade to the Complete Edition.",

The Saints have now become a household name, and their leader has become the president of the Unites States. The antagonists in Saints Row 4 are an invading alien race known as the Zin. Most of the game takes place within a computer simulation of the city of Steelport controlled by the Zin, where the protagonist is attempting to free himself and his companions.",

Everything is cryptic and the game is quite challenging, so prepare to feel lost and frustrated. But if&nbsp; you persevere, you may find something beautiful in it.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">-combat-</h1>\n<p>You only have one button for attacking and interacting besides directional movement. You can attack while moving by keeping the button pressed or attack standing still by tapping the button. You can also use the environment to your advantage, by cutting down trees that fall on enemies,&nbsp; launching bushes and more.&nbsp;While the combat looks simple, right spacing and quick rotation is required. Don't let the cute appearance of the game fool you, it is quite challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YPUlgIlzqlV1zTD2K0/giphy.gif\" loading=\"lazy\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><br></p>\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">-upgrades and collectables-</h1>\n<p>There are two types of resources in the game : \"moontears\", that are scattered around the world which are required to unlock doors, and \"enemies souls\" (*cough cough* Dark Souls ripoff)&nbsp;which can be used on sanctuaries for upgrading your sword size, movement speed or health. Also there are some secret smithing stations in the world, which can give you more abilities.</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://ambientmelancholy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/giphy-8.gif?strip=info&amp;w=480\" loading=\"lazy\"><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">-campfires-</h1>\n<p>Campfires are the \"checkpoint\" of the world where you&nbsp;can restore your health by resting on them,&nbsp; but the enemies also respawn&nbsp; (*cough cough* Dark Souls ripoff again).&nbsp; When you die you respawn on the latest campfire rested or passed closed by and&nbsp;you loose half of your \"souls\" ( I made this game before Sekiro came out so take that FromSoftware! That was original!),&nbsp; but you can go and get them back by killing your \"echo\" at the point of your death.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">-story-</h1>\n<p>One of the two great lights of the sky, the \"sun\" is gone. Now everyone is lost without her guidance and the world is filled with sorrow. But some lights, while quite dim and small,&nbsp; can radiate hope again.&nbsp;The game is quite cryptic. So you have to gather pieces of information and figure out what happened by yourself.</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://ambientmelancholy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/giphy-7.gif?strip=info&amp;w=480\" loading=\"lazy\"><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">-state of the game-</h1>\n<p>Be warned that this game is not finished and you will not find a climatic ending in it. Still the game is pretty large and it can offer up to 3-4 hours of gameplay. Feeling up the \"Lost Souls\" compendium and finding all the \"moontears\" could take many more. I made this game 4 years ago and worked on it for more than a year. I can't promise you that it will be finished but I would love to find out if people would be interested in it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2 class=\"text-center\">-controls-</h2>\n<p class=\"text-center\"></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Move Around with WASD or Keys</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\">Attack/Interact with SPACE or LMB</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;- press B on keyboard or Select on controller to open Compendium&nbsp;-</p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>A controller offers the best experience but mouse and keyboard are fine.</strong><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Personal Note :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I started making this game I believe back in 2018-2019. I worked on it for one and a half year, but as I usually do I&nbsp;got tired of it and let it get dust on the shelves of my hard drive. All these years making games I don't care about selling them or trying to do all the marketing stuff, I&nbsp;just enjoy designing games.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the years passed and&nbsp; got detached from this project, as I&nbsp;revisited it I felt like&nbsp; it deserves to be out there as a real game, even if I see many flaws in it or even if it is unfinished. I will not promote it or anything, I will just upload it here and let it die in public. But even if one person finds it and get's something out of it, that's more than enough ^^ Also why I decided to put a cost on it? I am not sure... Until now all my projects are free, I have very high standard of what a game should be.&nbsp;I do not expect to get any money from it, I just feel like this game even in it's current state, offers many hours of gameplay and must have taken more than a thousand hours to make it. So I think it deserves even a small price, doesn't it?&nbsp;^^</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Everything in this game was made by me except the music and sfx which are bought assets from the store or cc0 music from sites such as freesound and opengameart. I am pretty sure I used only copyrighted materials but if a non copyrighted sfx or music slipped in the game, let me know and I will remove it immediately. Managing a library of music and sound effects can be a nightmare. Thank you so much to everyone who is creating music and sfx for creators. You are a life saver &lt;3</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://ambientmelancholy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/cropped-cropped-amlogowhitetrans.png\" loading=\"lazy\"><br></p>",

Still Life 2 reveals the long-awaited ending of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://freebies.indiegala.com/still-life\" class=\"tcf-links-fc tcf-links-ft tcf-links-u\"><strong>Still Life</strong></a>&nbsp;and spells a new investigation for Agent Victoria McPherson.<br> <br>In Fall 2008, Victoria is sent to Maine where Ellen Dunnigan's body has just been found. The modus operandi and the video sent to the police and press leave them in no doubt as to the killer's identity: the East Coast Torturer has struck again! No clues are picked up during the autopsy, as the serial killer painstakingly washed the body. Once again, the killer has not committed any errors.<br> <br>From her motel room, Victoria comes across a report by Paloma Hernandez, the journalist covering all the crimes bearing the East Coast Torturer's signature. Hernandez has been highly critical of the FBI's and Victoria's lack of progress. That does not stop Hernandez from phoning and asking Victoria to meet her later that evening. Hernandez claims to have some so-called clues on the killer in her possession. Victoria flatly refuses. Just moments later, Paloma is kidnapped by the Torturer…<br> <br><strong>Still Life 2</strong>&nbsp;remains true to the spirit of its first installment, but now allows you to play and manage two characters bound by the same fate. This time, the aim is to control two heroines, see the game from two complementary viewpoints and experience two different gameplays. Depending on whether you are playing Paloma Hernandez, the victim being hunted by the killer or Victoria McPherson, the FBI agent tracking him down, you can alternate between survival and investigation.</p><br> <br><p>If possible, please support the developer on&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/46490/Still_Life_2/\" class=\"tcf-links-fc tcf-links-ft tcf-links-u\">Steam</a></strong>&nbsp;(by getting it there too or even wishlisting it).&nbsp;</p><br> <br><p><strong><a href=\"https://freebies.indiegala.com/?ref=freebies\" class=\"tcf-links-fc tcf-links-ft tcf-links-u\">Check out ALL the ongoing FREEbies here.</a></strong>&nbsp;</p><br>",

It filled the hearts of Driftland's inhabitants with new hope and energy. Determination for action diverted attention from the numerous conflicts between quarrelsome mage-rulers and various injuries sustained by those who did not give in to their will.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nOutlaw rebels, by the mage-rulers called <b>Nomads</b>, are exterminated and treated as barbarians. They believe that the new order is an attempt to restore balance in shape that has once destroyed the planet.</i>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>Now, the Nomads must fight to defend their values and survive.</b><h4>About the game</h4><br><b>Nomads of Driftland</b> is an RTS game initially created as an add-on to <b>Driftland: The Magic Revival</b>. Since it is significantly different from the base game, we decided to release it as a standalone expansion and make it available for free. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nBase game - <b>Driftland: The Magic Revival</b> is a unique fusion of RTS, 4X strategy, and Sim genres in a fantasy world made up of the shattered planet. The player takes on the role of a powerful mage-ruler capable of moving and reshaping parts of the planet. Both game mechanics and history are based on an innovative concept of dynamic topography and issuing orders to individuals with free will.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nNomads do not have a ruler and do not carry out orders like other races in the base game. <b>Units are managed directly, like in classic RTS games</b>. New unit types/classes affect strategy on the battlefield.",

Players with less violent intent can find secret paths to complete Mable without killing anything, including bosses. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nUnlike most Metroidvanias Mable does not allow you to run, jump and kill on your own. Instead, you must use non-human forms to attack creatures and traverse through difficult challenges. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n<br>\n\n<br>\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, <i>what will you do?</i> In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill <i>everyone.</i>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>Will you banish the darkness, or will you become it?</b>\n\n<h4>COMBAT IS MOVEMENT</h4>\nThe way you move is deadly.

Thus fate takes its inevitable course and threatens to throw the world out of order.<br>\n<br>\nScarlett finds out that she is the daughter of death incarnate and is blessed with his ultimate powers. She is the only one who can stop the gruesome powers that threaten to destroy the entire living world.<br>\n<br>\nNow it’s your chance to reverse fate! Get ready for a fast-paced adventure set in an epic world filled with dark dangers and merciless adversaries.

A new death is selected regularly by “Corpus”, a secret council. This time however Corpus really makes a wrong decision: The “new” death, Victor, turns out to be a crazed necromancer who manages to turn himself into an overpowering undead with seedy tricks and dark rituals and thus attains almost unlimited power in addition to immortality. As it is strictly forbidden for the chosen death to devote himself to necromancy, the committee revokes Victor’s nomination immediately and declares a new death in his stead without delay. <br>\n<br>\nThe power-hungry Victor however does not want to relinquish his position again. He continues to practice the dark arts in order to gather numerous dark and dangerous creatures and tainted souls from the underworld around him. He thus succeeds in eliminating the newly designated death and takes over his power for his own purposes. The effects on the world’s balance are calamitous and – should Victor be able to keep himself in power – its dark consequences are irreversible. Only a person who has the same mighty powers as Victor can prevent his prevailing and vent him his deserved punishment. <br>\n<br>\nScarlett, the daughter of the real death does not know anything about her ancestry and the hidden talents which slumber within her. She is immersed suddenly in this story due to the brutal attack on her home village and the tragic loss of Benedict, the love of her life. It is a story which she now begins to write herself, a story during the course of which she unleashes her capabilities, a story in which she tries to save Benedict from the world of the dead and a story in which she must protect the world of the living from the dark threat posed by Victor and his henchmen.",

The tournament at the centre of the game is sponsored by an unknown patron, whose identity becomes a matter of public interest in the country. Perhaps as a result of this, it attracts a large number of contestants.\n<br>\n<br>With the inception of the new \"multi-shift\" rule in this KOF tournament, wherein competitors can freely tag off during battles, the competition becomes a 'hot topic' and provokes widespread discussion. It also leads to a speedy execution of the match with unified team strategies.\n<br>\n<br>In preparation for the tournaments, stadiums with the capacity to hold tens of thousands of people are procured from cities across the world and established in city centres. Schedules are completed and spectators move from one location to another to watch the preliminary matches. To create the atmosphere of a true street fight, competitions are broadcast live on giant screens.",

The story starts in a little-known protodynastic period in which you will be able to observe the birth of the Old Egypt and finished with the death of Cleopatra VII.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_01.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nThe most important aspect is the skillful management of urban planning by shaping the grid of streets, placing buildings and their mutual relation. Well-designed city will greatly improve economic efficiency which may convert into city income. \n<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>Diplomacy and politics:</b>\n<br>\nThe governor will face very difficult<b> choices</b> to be made in a constantly changing political environment. Costly expeditions, Pharaoh and other cities requests, military threat and a mixture of different cultures will be a commonplace. A series of wrong choices can cost the loss of trading partners and low interest in the city by settlers. Moreover, the total lack of obedience to the rulers may <b>end up with a civil war.   </b>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_02.jpg\">\n\n<br>\n<b>Religion:</b>\n<br>\nDeity will be able to interfere with daily life but it will be done implicitly. The main aspect of religion will be satisfying the need for access to the places of worship, providing supplies for temples or organizing festivals. Neglecting this sphere may result in a dangerous social unrest on a par with e.g.<b> famine</b>.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>Trade:</b>\n<br>\nTrade is the<b> most important element in royal treasury</b>. Without it, it is very difficult for economic stability built solely on taxes. Therefore, in the interest of the player, producing  goods for export at prices that will be able to change dynamically depending on the geopolitical situation, will be required.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/builders_of_egypt/gog_main_03.jpg\">\n\n<br>\n<b>Monuments:</b>\n<br>\n<b>What would the real Ancient Egypt be without its monumental sacred architecture?</b> There are mastabas, obelisks, Karnak among others, the Ramesseum and of course the pyramids that <b>are waiting to be built</b>. You will be able to <b>observe the slow process of construction</b>. A team of carpenters, masons, architects and ordinary workers will rise building step by step. It will not be just a graphic feature - the building process is costly and will have an impact on the finances or the public mood.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<b>War</b>\n<br>\nEgypt's history is full of clashes of emerging and failing empires. You will have the responsibility of defending cities from foreign military attacks, making plans to attack and joining your forces on Pharaoh's own call.",

    "Description": "NOTE: The Director’s Cut is free to existing owners of the Dragonfall expansion for Shadowrun Returns.\n<br><br>\nShadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.\n<br><br>\nIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\n<br><br>\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\n<br><br>\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\n<br><br>\n<b>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features:</b>\n<br><br>\n<b>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG</b>: See why PC Gamer hailed Dragonfall as “one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.” Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\n<br><br>\n<b>A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting</b>: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\n<br><br>\n<b>Command Your Team</b>: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\n<br><br>\n<b>Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat</b>: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.\n<br><br>\n<b>Skill-Based Character Progression</b>: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.\n<br><br>\n<b>New in the Director’s Cut:</b>\n<br><br>\n<b>Standalone</b>: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!\n<br><br>\n<b>Five All-New Missions</b>: The Director’s Cut features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.\n<br><br>\n<b>Revamped Combat System</b>: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.\n<br><br>\nRedesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.\n<br><br>\n<b>Customize Your Team</b>: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.\n<br><br>\n<b>Ten New Pieces of Original Music</b>: Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the Dragonfall experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack</b>: As a free bonus, the Director’s Cut includes the entire soundtracks from both Dragonfall AND our previous title, Shadowrun Returns. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the Director’s Cut. Featuring music from the composers of the classic Shadowrun SEGA and SNES games, this exciting cyberpunk soundtrack pays homage to the past with a modern sentiment.",

    "Description": "<p><strong>Deep Despair</strong>&nbsp;is a retro-styled survival sandbox. The game repeats many of the mechanics of the notorious Minecraft, but most of them in the game are rethought for the sake of realism and credibility. The game world is divided into 4 levels: the upper world, caves, caves with rivers and caves with lava. At each level there is a descent to the next level. Going below, you can find and extract more valuable resources. Abandoned mines are also found in dungeons. Traveling around the world, you can get various resources necessary for crafting and survival. Implemented a dynamic change of time of day. For a poorly developed character, night becomes a serious test, so it is recommended to spend it in the house that you need to have time to build. A bonfire, food, weapons and shelter are all you need for successful survival. You can freely explore the whole world and plan your actions in any order. Travel, collect resources, craft items, dig, build, grow crops and survive. All in the best traditions of Minecraft!<br><br><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br>• Complete freedom of action<br><br>• Over 100 units of content<br><br>• Big worlds to explore<br><br>• Advanced hunger system<br><br>• Craft items<br><br>• Construction and gathering<br><br>• Cultivation of crops<br><br>• Hunting and survival<br><br><br><br><strong>Gameplay mechanics:</strong><br><br><strong>• Wood mining</strong><br><br>To get wood, you need to cut down the tree, put the fallen logs on the ground and again chop them with an ax. Then several units of wood suitable for crafting will fall out.<br><br><strong>• Bonfires</strong><br><br>A bonfire is needed for frying meat and potatoes. It is assembled from sticks and ignited by a flint. To fry food, you need to put raw meat in a fire, wait for the condition and pick up when the meat is ready. Condition can be traced to the changed food icon. The bonfire goes out over time, so it is necessary to throw brushwood (sticks). You can put out a watering can or a bucket of water. Destroyed by any tool, breaking up into sticks.<br><br><strong>• Cultivation of crops</strong><br><br>In the game you can grow wheat and potatoes. Wheat seeds can be obtained from tall grass or by the interaction of a hoe with a block of grass. When digging up the soil with a low chance, potatoes or fertilizer may fall out. They can also be found in chests in mines.<br><br>To plant, you need to loosen the soil with a hoe and stick the seeds. Crops grow only on moist soil. It automatically becomes wet if there is water nearby. Otherwise, hydration is carried out using a watering can filled with water. The soil dries out over time, so it needs to be watered periodically. The use of fertilizer or bone meal on the soil increases the growth of crops by 2 times.<br><br><strong>• Nutrition</strong><br><br>The game implements a hunger system, so the character needs to constantly eat.

Avoiding the people\npursuing her, she needs to clear her name and unravel the mystery of an\nominous medieval order of alchemists and mystics.

There’s a story mode with 30 levels followed by an unlockable “Infinite Trials” mode with challenging randomised/procedural levels.&nbsp;Playtime will vary depending on your skill level but as a guide:</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">1-Player story game: 2-3 hours</p>\n<p>2-Player story game: 2-3 hours</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">3-Player story game: 2-3 hours</p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">4-Player story game: 2-3 hours <br></p>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">“The Infinite Trials”: 1-999 hours! Or maybe ∞ hours :) Complete as many randomised/procedural levels in a row as you can without losing.

I already have the core mechanics down. The first part of the story is already in the works. I'm pretty sure I can pull it off.</p>\n<p><em>Q) What kind of help do you need?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) I need help with balancing the game, help with how new features are implemented and helpful suggestions (features, bugs, etc).</p>\n<p><em>Q) Where should I put my suggestions?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) You can leave you suggestion in the discussion board down below. If I get enough people to help me out, I'll create a discord server.</p>\n<p><em>Q) Do you plan on a PC release?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) Yes, I do intend to release a PC version of the game. But I will release it after the Android version.</p>\n<p><em>Q) What about iOS?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) I personally use iOS (Currently) and I would like to release an iOS version but sadly, I don't think that it is possible because I do not have a MAC and the iTunes store license is too expensive for me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Q) ETA wen?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) I am currently in the last year of school and I do not/am not given lots of time to work on this project. The development will greatly speed up next year.</p>\n<p><em>Q) What will my donations be used for?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) Currently, my laptop cannot handle my game engine very well. I cannot implement some features due to this hardware limitation. Your donations will help me upgrade to a more capable PC. My goal is to get around 800$. I will greatly appreciate all donations.</p>\n<p><em>Q) How do I support you?</em><br></p>\n<p>A) You can use the donate option while downloading the prototype. You can choose to buy the artwork pack (Contains gun sprites right now. Will be updated) or/and the itch.io bundle (Contains all the prototypes from the start of development). These packs have very little value on their own but will help me greatly if you buy them.</p>\n<p>Thank You All!</p>",

Each level is endless untill your mothership is fully charged, then&nbsp;BOOM! The planet is destroyed!<br><br><br></p>\n<p>There was once an race, named the Kuuu, for the longest time they were a peaceful race, bent on exploring the galaxy, and making new friends. But one day, they came across an alien race, there name unknown, but are only nick-named \"The overlords.\" The overlords had the weapons, to wipe out the Kuuu in one fast sweep. However, they decided to make a deal with them instead. The overlords said to the Kuuu, Work for us, or we will wipe out the Kuuu from ALL history. The kuuu had no option, but to agree. After that agreement, The Overlords forced the Kuuu to create weapons, and a hostile invasion force. For over 3,000 years, the Kuuu attacked and destroyed race after race, after race. As the race's begged them to be saved.. They were wiped out. The Kuuu was unstoppable, there fleet, numberless, there weapons, can destroy planets faster then anything ever created! Then, after they wiped out the race named the Jumpa, The Overlords updated them to the next target.. A new alien race, that just achieved the ability for warp speed. The Overlords told the Kuuu leader, this alien race is the biggest threat out there, it puts not only The Overlords at risk of being destroyed, but the Kuuu as well. This alien race, there history is nothing but endless wars, they are always fighting each other nonstop! They are even killing the own ground they live on! They hoped that this race would kill it's self before they found warp power, but that did not go as planned. They worn the Kuuu this will be the hardest War they would ever fight, the Kuuu was ready.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Kuuu declared war with Earth, and the Human race.</p>\n<p>5 months into the war, the human race has lost there colones on planets all over the sol system, as the fighting was getting closer and closer to earth, it seems it would be an easy victory for the Kuu, to the point were the Generals were laughing and taunting The Overlords for being so \"Scard of the squishy flesh.\" At this rate, the Kuuu would have earth by there Christmas.</p>\n<p>Then, the boom happened.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To this date, the Kuuu that remain, still don't know if the humans caused it, or it was just something that happen with the Sol star, or, a greater force was angry with them. When they were about to invade Earth, the sol star, realshed a solar flair, normally, would cause no damage to the Kuuu star ships. But this flair, was different. It was stronger, faster, and bigger then anything The Kuuu has ever seen. The solar flair hit there fleet in sol, casing the crews to bake inside, and the pull of Earth caused the ships to come crashing down to the planet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was the turning point Earth needed.</p>\n<p>The humans then built there own Warships, created a fleet out of nothing in a matter for a few months. While the Kuuu regrouped at Sol system, near Pluto, Earth, had 200 new Warships, armed with laser weapons and Shield-busting nukes, were once inside the shielding, exploded, destroying the ship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The war raged on, for 3 years. Earth fought and fought, the Kuuu numberless fleet, became numbered, as the number became smaller and smaller,, and ever planet the Kuuu has taken for The Overlords was taken by the Humans. The Kuuu tried to contact The Overlords, but they heard nothing. They were alone in this fight. The humans did not want surrender of the Kuuu, but there complete annihilation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final battle ground was at the home planet of the Kuuu, Planet Ku-wa. Both sides fought for days, but in the end.. Earth killed every last Kuuu on the planet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now all that remains, is one mother ship, an a small fleet.

Extreme climate change, global economic crisis, a lethal pandemic, and increasing tension between old and new superpowers. For the first time since 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict. Mushroom clouds rose from east to west before the dust settled.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nNow it’s over and the Earth is still. Nature has invaded ruined cities. Wind sweeps through empty streets, turned into graveyards.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe humans are all gone. Scavenging through the remains of civilization are the Mutants, deformed humanoids and animals alike, searching for salvation or just something to eat. To survive, you and your companions must venture out to explore the Zone.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nMaybe one day you will find the Eden of legends, the ancients’ haven in the middle of hell. That’s where truth awaits, the stories say. Maybe you will find your answers there.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThen again, maybe it’s all bullshit.\n<br>\n<br><h4>TACTICAL COMBAT</h4>\n<center><video muted preload=\"auto\" loop autoplay=\"autoplay\" width=\"600\" >\n  <source src=\"https://items.gog.com/mutant_year_zero_road_to_eden/Tactical-Combat.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></center><br>\n\nMutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is the ultimate fix for your tactical strategy addiction. Dive into a deep, turn-based, tactical combat system inspired by the XCOM games.\n\n<br><br><h4>EXPLORE A POST-HUMAN EARTH</h4>\n<center><video muted preload=\"auto\" loop autoplay=\"autoplay\" width=\"600\" >\n  <source src=\"https://items.gog.com/mutant_year_zero_road_to_eden/Explore-a-Post-Human-World.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video></center><br>\n\nJourney through a post-human world of abandoned cities, crumbling highways, and overgrown countryside.

Real-time stealth allows you full control of approach: sneak into an enemy camp, position the team of Mutants to your advantage, and gain the element of surprise.\n\n<br><br><h4>UNLOCK MUTATIONS</h4>\n<center><video muted preload=\"auto\" loop autoplay=\"autoplay\" width=\"600\" >\n  <source src=\"https://items.gog.com/mutant_year_zero_road_to_eden/Unlock-Mutations.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video></center><br>\n\nUnlock new mutations and abilities for your Mutants, such as Selma’s grasping vines, Bormin’s Charge, and Dux‘ uncanny ability to sneak into a camp full of enemies unnoticed, despite being a 4-foot tall walking, talking duck with a crossbow.\n\n<br><br><h4>DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT</h4>\n<center><video muted preload=\"auto\" loop autoplay=\"autoplay\" width=\"600\" >\n  <source src=\"https://items.gog.com/mutant_year_zero_road_to_eden/Dynamic-Environment.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></center><br>\n\nUse the environment to your advantage.

    "Description": "England, 12th century: Philip the monk becomes Prior of the small abbey of Kingsbridge. At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n<br>\n<br>The game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n<br>\n<br>The game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

    "Description": "Crossed Swords is a hack & slash action RPG arcade game developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade system in 1990 and Neo Geo console in 1991. Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.[1]\n<br>\n<br>The game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game's perspective may be considered either first-person[1] or third-person.[3] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator.[4] A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port.[5]",

    "Description": "In the dark and twisted cities of tomorrow, corporate syndicates compete for global dominance. But the boardroom deals and corporate takeovers of the future look very different from today: they are lead by marketing directors who manage teams of half-men, half-machine cyborgs with no conscience and plenty of guns.\n<br><br>\nYou are an ambitious marketing director in the Syndicate, hand-picked to lead a team of cyborg mercenaries. You work in the problem-solving department and you are damn good at \"taking care\" of problems. Some might say that violence is not the answer but you know better. There here are hardly any problems that you can't solve with a well-placed bullet. Collateral damage in the local population and infrastructure during the “negotiations” is, as always, acceptable. After all, what would you expect form the dystopian futuristic world run by mega-corporations?\n<br><br>\nSyndicate is Bullfrog’s masterpiece of a game in which you aren’t saving the world or protecting innocents. You just make sure that your employers get what they want. At your disposal are four cyborg agents, an impressive arsenal of weapons and gadgets, and a massive selection of cybernetic upgrades. You are free to unleash this power on a highly interactive map where you can blow up buildings, steal cars, light trees on fire, or just shoot stuff. Produced by Peter Molyneux himself, Syndicate is the essence of cyberpunk and, with its great music, stylized visuals, and mind-blowing atmosphere, it has earned its place among the best games of all time. Make sure to check out the game that secured Bullfrog's place in game development hall of fame.\n<br><br>\n<I><b>Installation on Windows Vista or 7: </b> Syndicate should be installed by using the \"Run as Administrator\" option.

    "Description": "Dive into the Middle Ages and play the successor to the worldwide #1 hit, Bridge Constructor\n<br>\n<br>Bridge Constructor Medieval turns back the clock a few centuries to the time of knights and castles. Build sturdy bridges to supply your city with provisions - or cunningly constructed bridges that collapse under the weight of attacking troops, sending the horde of enemies into the abyss below. You won’t even be safe from cannon fire in the 40 brand new levels. Protect your foot soldiers and your horse-drawn carriages with covered bridges and stable pillar structures.\n<br>\n<br>There are a total of five materials available to help you build the perfect bridge: wood, heavy wood, stone and ropes, along with the new addition of the bridge roof. Throughout the exciting background story, you will familiarize yourself with the various materials on a step-by-step basis, and learn everything you need to know so that your bridges meet the requirements of the different levels.\n<br>\n<br>Innovative game modes in store for you! Besides building stable bridges, there's also plenty on offer for veterans to discover in the new game modes. In the siege level, your bridge is bombarded by enemy catapults. Strengthen your bridge so that it doesn't collapse, and protect your own troops on the bridge with a bridge roof.\n<br>\n<br>In another new game mode, you build your bridges so that they collapse under the load of enemy units to send as many of them as possible into the abyss. In addition, the unique bonus challenges will leave even the most experienced players at their wit’s end. That way, both bridge-building professionals and novices will face a challenge in Bridge Constructor Medieval.",

    "Description": "<i>Betrayer</i> is a first person action adventure game that takes you to the New World at the turn of the 17th century.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe year is 1604. You sailed from England expecting to join a struggling colony on the coast of Virginia. Instead, you find only ghosts and mysteries. What catastrophe blighted the land and drained it of color and life? Where are the settlers and tribes who lived here? \n<br>\n\n<br>\nClue by clue, you must piece together the story of what befell this doomed settlement and find a way to set things right. You will be hunted by corrupted Conquistadors and ravening shadows as you explore an expansive wilderness in order to trace the brief, tragic history of the colony and search for survivors.<h4>Key Features</h4><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore large, open environments teeming with danger and discovery. Chart your own course in search of clues and treasures. \n<br>\n</li><li>Switch between two distinct worlds featuring different enemies, obstacles, and threats. \n<br>\n</li><li>Wield early 17th century weaponry including muskets, bows, crossbows, and tomahawks. Upgrade your arsenal by purchasing or finding faster, deadlier, longer-ranged weapons. \n<br>\n</li><li>Charge headlong into battle with guns blazing or pick enemies off quietly. A novel, movement-based stealth system lets you hide in plain sight or use the wind to mask your footsteps. \n<br>\n</li><li>Equip ability-enhancing Charms to complement your play style, granting anything from extra health to faster movement to improved stealth.\n<br>\n</li><li>Play with the default visual style for maximum eeriness and tension or customize the color and contrast settings to suit your tastes. </li></ul><h4>About Blackpowder Games</h4>Our ongoing mission is to create first person action experiences that are distinctive, compelling, and memorable regardless of scope or platform.

Many years after the banishment of the evil that plagued the land, the world was hit by waves of unbearable heat. Crops are withering, rivers and wells drying and the cattle is slowly dying out from illness.<br><br><br><br>During his desperate work to save his family farm from the heat, young farmer named Jory was suddenly visited by a mysterious stranger claiming that the land could be saved and that he is the one who can help save it.<br><br><br><br>Despite his skepticism, in desperation he accepted the strangers offer and was instantly transferred to a strange flying metal contraption where three other people waited.<br><br><br><br>The stranger explained to them that the thing that plagues this world is not a natural, but man made disaster. An evil and immortal tyrant, together with his evil legions from times past is manipulating the Sun that heats their world and the very fabric of time. All to fulfill his goal of utter time and space domination. Coming from a time where the tyrant already established domination, the stranger known as Cooper came back in an attempt to rewrite time and thus save both present and the future from utter destruction.<br><br><br><br>He explained to his four guests that even though they are not warriors they all carry genes of great heroes of the past. Using his superior technology he can make Jory and his new friends capable of combating any threat that comes their way.</p><br><br><p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br><br><br>Each character will choose his own unique class among the rich variety that \"The Space Crusade\" offers. Despite this, they will not only be defined by their class of choice, but also with their inherent abilities (i.e. farmer Jory will be more sturdy then his companions, while grifter Laura will be more agile then the rest). Every class will be able to use a wide variety of abilities that will enable them to combat their more technologically advanced foes. The number of possible encounters is fixed, so there will not be any tedious level grinding. After each level up the player will choose new skills, and with it the way their characters develop combat-wise. Goal of the game is to reach the Sun where the tyrant resides while combating his legions, both human and mutated monstrosities.<br><br><br><br><strong>CHARACTERS</strong><br><br><br><br>Jory - small town farmer with a wild youth, but after his father died he settled down to run his family farm in his honor.<br><br><br><br>Dante - young scholar with an interest in engineering. He accepted Cooper's call to observe his advanced technology.<br><br><br><br>Laura - grifter from the Capital City that joined Cooper to flee the guards chasing her after her last scam.<br><br><br><br>Victoria - initiate in a secluded temple yearning for adventure and an opportunity to help her fellow man.<br><br><br><br>Cooper - time-traveling stranger from a ruined future. He traveled back in time to stop the problem at its root.

Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system.",

Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n<br>\n<br>Hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n<br>\n<br>HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n<br>\n<br>An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n<br>\n<br>Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n<br>\n<br>Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",

    "Description": "A galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in <i>Star Wars</i> Jedi: Fallen Order™, a new third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven, single-player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of <i>Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith</i>. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities and master the art of the iconic lightsaber – all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \n<br>\n<br>\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense <i>Star Wars</i> lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \n<br>\n<br>\n<i>Star Wars</i> fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, creatures, droids and adversaries. As part of this authentic <i>Star Wars</i> story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase them completely.\n<br>\n<br>\nKEY FEATURES\n<br>\n<br>\n●<b>Cinematic, Immersive Combat</b> – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging – partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\n<br>\n<br>\n●<b>A New Jedi Story Begins</b> – As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration and puzzle-solving.\n<br>\n<br>\n●<b>The Galaxy Awaits</b> – Ancient forests, windswept rock faces and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways, leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\n<br>\n<br>\nGet the story behind the game with the <i>Star Wars</i> Jedi: Fallen Order Deluxe Edition, which includes:\n<ul>\n<li>Crimson BD-1 skin</li>\n<li>Crimson Mantis skin</li>\n<li>Digital Art Book</li>\n<li>“Director’s Cut” behind-the-scenes videos, featuring over 90 minutes of footage from the making of the game</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>",

Mayhem may ensue, but we’re certain you can come to senses and never steer off-course.<br> <br>What are you waiting for, driver? Rev that engine, strap on your helmet, empty a few bottles and truly put your skills to the test in a sequel to a parody which definitely doesn’t encourage such behavior in real life. Limit your reckless driving solely to video games and that hangover will disappear faster than flipping the wheels (or tank tracks) in this tongue-in-cheek simulation!<br> <br><br> <br>Key features:<br> <br>- Three types of transport vehicles ranging from tanks to custom off-road trucks.<br> <br>- Three camera modes.<br> <br>- The high probability of experiencing drunk vision.<br> <br>- Challenging driving highlighted by obstacles and time limits.</p><br> <br><p>&nbsp;</p><br>",

    "Description": "<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/coldwar.gif\" ><h4>STORY</h4>From the creators of the award-winning sci-fi game Out There...\n<br>\n\n<br>\nIn the near future, a paradigm-shifting scientific discovery looms over the world, promising radical new technologies. The world’s superpowers realize they could have the power to destroy the global financial system, wipe out entire countries or even gain access to immortality. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nHowever, this discovery — called “The Sigma Theory” — can only be harnessed by a handful of scientists. You are placed at the head of your country’s Sigma division. Your objective is to ensure that it is your nation that reaps the benefits of Sigma Theory before anyone else. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nTo achieve this you will have powerful resources at your disposal: a cadre of the world’s most elite covert agents, advanced tactical drones and, of course, your own skills in diplomacy and subterfuge. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nIt’s a cold war out there, one in which mankind must face up to its future.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/drone.gif\" ><h4>THE ULTIMATE ESPIONAGE SIMULATION</h4><b>Turn-based espionage:</b> Use your special agents to dominate the world. Seduction, blackmail, manipulation, industrial espionage… Every low blow is both permitted and encouraged.\n<br>\n<b>Dynamic narrative:</b> Develop and manage your relations with over 100 NPCs: lobbies, armed groups, politicians… Alliance, deception or assassination, you choose. \n<br>\n<b>Field operations:</b> Direct the kidnapping of your targets during gripping pursuits through the world’s greatest cities. Discretion or direct confrontation, your agent’s life is in your hands.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/recruitment.jpg\">\n<b>Recruitment</b>\n<br>\nFirst, recruit a team of four special agents from 50 unique unlockable characters to support your missions. Each comes with their own story, motivations and traits that define their behavior during missions.\n<br>\nAccess the investigator, soldier, hacker, seducer and other archetypes to complete your Sigma division and execute your strategy.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/map.jpg\">\n<b>Espionage</b>\n<br>\nWhen your team is ready, assign them missions around the world to gather scientists, discover compromising documents on local politicians, and more.\n<br>\nExploit your agents’ abilities to seduce, manipulate and bribe your targets over to your side or have them neutralized.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/interrogation.jpg\">\n<b>Counter-espionage</b>\n<br>\nOther nations will also use their agents to infiltrate your country and seize your scientists. Track, capture and interrogate them to gain information on your enemies, then exchange them for ransom when they are no longer useful.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/exfiltration.jpg\">\n<b>Exfiltration</b>\n<br>\nOrder your agents to exfiltrate scientists recruited to your cause during gripping turn-based exfiltration phases through the world’s greatest capitals. Choose the position your drones wisely to support these delicate missions.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/reddragon.jpg\">\n<b>Diplomacy</b>\n<br>\nIn Sigma Theory, diplomacy is the key to achieving your goals. Meet your foreign counterparts and further your objectives using flattery, threats or blackmail. You can also recover your captured agents, advance your research, and much more. Develop your relations with powerful lobbies and armed and influential groups to obtain their favor. But be careful, they may turn on you.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/sigma_theory_global_cold_war/tech.jpg\">\n<b>Tech Tree</b>\n<br>\nSigma Theory is the cause of this cold war. Rally scientists from around the world to your cause to discover new technologies to gain the edge and change the world. Mind control, destabilization of the world economy, robot soldiers, immortality… Will you keep these discoveries for yourself or share them with the world?<h4> Games that inspired us: </h4>XCom, Phantom Doctrine, Plague Inc, Pandemic (board game), Rocket Ranger, Tropico, Armello, Civilization, Curious Expedition and so much more",

    "Description": "<i>The Swine are Rising! </i>\n<br>\nIn 2010 Frictional Games terrified the world with the cult horror Amnesia: A Dark Descent. Now they bring you a new nightmare. Created in collaboration with The Chinese Room, the studio behind Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an intense and terrifying journey into the heart of darkness\nthat lurks within us all.\n<br><br>\n<i>The year is 1899</i>\n<br>\nWealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus awakes in his bed, wracked with fever and haunted by dreams\nof a dark and hellish engine. Tortured by visions of a disastrous expedition to Mexico, broken on the\nfailing dreams of an industrial utopia, wracked with guilt and tropical disease, he wakes into a\nnightmare. The house is silent, the ground beneath him shaking at the will of some infernal machine:\nall he knows is that his children are in grave peril, and it is up to him to save them.\n<br><br>\n<i>Step back into the horror</i>\n<br>\nLike The Dark Descent, this is a game driven by its story, exploration of the world and the constant\nfear of the unknown. You can expect classic Amnesia gameplay, physics interaction and the\nsignature blend of high-end gaming with low system requirements.\n<br><br>\n<i>Think you understand fear? Think again. </i>\n<br>\nA Machine for Pigs takes both the world of Amnesia and the technology of The Dark Descent to new\nheights of horror. Built using an updated version of HPL2 engine, the game features stunning visual\nand environment design, incredible music and audio effects and adapted artificial intelligence. These\nare all driven by a gut-wrenching, blood-curdling new story, set sixty years after the events of the\noriginal game.",

    "Description": "The second installment in the AoF series added the \"rage gauge\"; similar to the \"spirit system\" of its predecessor, it limited the use and effectiveness of special attacks.\n<br>The game's story is set a year after the original. Geese Howard, a rising star in South Town's criminal underworld, calls fighters to the city for a new tournament, \"The King of Fighters.\" Howard was the final boss and series villain of SNK's other fighting game franchise Fatal Fury (though he is a secret boss in this game), whose story took place over a decade after the events of Art of Fighting.\n<br>Art of Fighting 2 was the only time Yuri Sakazaki was a playable character in the series. It also marked the only time that she donned her trademark outfit, which was made famous in The King of Fighters series. This game also marks the debut of Takuma Sakazaki without his Mr. Karate persona, as well as Eiji Kisaragi, who both appear in the King of Fighters series. Ryuhaku Todo, the first boss in the original AOF, is the only character dropped; all characters are playable from the beginning. The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance.\n<br>This game is also notorious for its difficulty, with it being referred in many fighting circles as having some of the toughest opponent AI in a fighting game.",

    "Name": "Metro: Last Light Redux",
    "Description": "It is the year 2034. Beneath the ruins of post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of the Metro, the remnants of mankind are besieged by deadly threats from outside – and within. Mutants stalk the catacombs beneath the desolate surface, and hunt amidst the poisoned skies above. \n<br><br>\nBut rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro are locked in a struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of the earth forever. As Artyom, burdened by guilt but driven by hope, you hold the key to our survival – the last light in our darkest hour…\n<br><br>\n<b>Product Overview:</b><br>\nMetro: Last Light Redux is the definitive version of the critically acclaimed ‘Metro: Last Light’, rebuilt in the latest and greatest iteration of the 4A Engine for Next Gen. Newcomers will get the chance to experience one of the finest story-driven shooters of all time; an epic adventure combining gripping survival horror, exploration and tactical combat and stealth. \n<br><br>\nThis definitive version also includes all previously released DLC, adding 10 hours of bonus single-player content to the huge solo campaign. Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations. \n<br><br>\nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel ‘Metro 2033’ will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles – Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival. With the legendary Ranger Mode included to offer an extra layer of challenge and immersion, Metro: Last Light Redux offers hours of AAA gameplay for an incredible price.\n<br><br>\nBased on the internationally bestselling novel series by Dmitry Glukhovsky",

We feel confident that your skills and integrity will ensure that this state of affairs will never arise.\n<br><br>\nSincerely,<br>\nThe EuroCorp Board of Directors\n<br><br>\nWelcome to an urban hell of ultra-violent mayhem. Welcome to Syndicate Wars where you’ll take control of a squad of cybernetically enhanced Agents and wreak havoc on the enemy.

The game has been built with modding in mind! A bundled SDK allows you to build pre-packaged mods, adding anything from new names, to plugging in full-blown systems in native C/C++.

    "Description": "<b>Seven: The Days Long Gone</b> is an open-world, isometric role-playing game, in which you play as Teriel, a master thief sent on a mission that will shake the foundations of the Vetrall Empire. Free roam across the vibrant prison island of Peh, and choose whether to help or exploit its many citizens.<br><br>\n\nIf there’s one place that Master Thief Teriel avoids at all costs, it’s the prison island of Peh. But when a daring heist takes an unexpected turn, Teriel finds himself shackled on an airship bound for the infamous island. To make matters worse, the daemon inside his head makes it very clear that the thief will never leave unless he does exactly what he’s told.<br><br>\n\n<b>In Seven: The Days Long Gone</b> you play as Teriel. You must use all of your cunning and clandestine skills to escape a web of deceit and betrayal, and ultimately survive Peh.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b><h4>EXPLORE A VIBRANT OPEN WORLD FROM AN ISOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE</b></h4> From the moment you set foot on Peh, the island is open to you. Sneak, run, climb, and fight your way across a colourful array of environments. You are free to explore wherever you please; only security checkpoints, monster-infested areas, and dangerous factions stand in your way!\n<b><h4>CHOOSE YOUR PLAYSTYLE</b></h4>  As a master thief, Teriel is well versed in the art of stealth. Get the jump on enemies from behind and above, fool everyone with cunning disguises, or just use the environment to keep out of sight entirely. If things go wrong, however, or you’re feeling impatient, there’s nothing to stop you from letting loose with an array of devastating weapons, and unleashing deadly magical skills upon your foes.\n<b><h4>ENCOUNTER A MYRIAD OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS</b></h4>  Encounter an array of people, from despondent slaves and prisoners through to rich socialites. Just be sure to keep an eye out for the two major factions on Peh: the Biomancers and the Technomagi. In such a desperate place, there are many who will take any help they can get. Choose whether to help or exploit Peh’s inhabitants, but be prepared for the consequences.\n<b><h4>UNCOVER AN EPIC STORY OF DECEIT AND TREACHERY</b></h4> On Peh, everyone has an agenda, and often there’s more than meets the eye. Dive into a world teeming with distrust, and crushed between the machinations of mighty powers. Work with the daemon that has possessed you to complete a mission of utmost importance. The fate of the Vetrall Empire rests in your hands.",

    "Description": "Age of Empires Online is a multiplayer online real-time strategy game developed by Robot Entertainment and Gas Powered Games, which released on August 16, 2011. Based upon the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, it was originally developed by Robot Entertainment, but on February 24, 2011, Gas Powered Games, took over production. The game was published by Microsoft.\n<br>\n<br>The game was free-to-play—it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features.\n<br>\n<br>On March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money.\n<br>\n<br>As of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows – Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain.\n<br>\n<br>In 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed. It was finalized and released on March 14th, 2021",

A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nImagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now, picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes, that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it, think of Trüberbrook, a remote village in rural, mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because, that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares, you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least, that’s how it seems. But don't fear, instead of getting some rest, you could find yourself having to save the world …\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/still_02.jpg\">\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/features.png\">\n\n<br>\n<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><b>Suspense!

The game will be enhanced by several new features thanks to the joint force of our 5078 wonderful backers! <3\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/story.png\">\n\n<br>\n<b>The year is 1967.</b> The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam, Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe, students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nOn a larger scale, the world is locked in turmoil, but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked, sleepy part in the German province. <b>Hans Tannhauser</b>, an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue, he wins a trip to a small, German village, <b>Trüberbrook</b>. Truber-what? No idea! It doesn’t help he can’t remember taking part in any lottery in the first place … Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics, he makes his way to Trüberbrook, Germany, bursting with curiosity.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nBut shortly after his arrival, inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why?\n<br>\n\n<br>\nGradually, he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests, one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Greta Lemke, who is on a research trip to Trüberbrook, seems normal to him. Before he knows it, Greta becomes Tannhauser’s accomplice on the <b>adventure of a lifetime</b>! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tüberbrook is not accidental – he is here to save the world!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/still_01.jpg\">\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/characters.png\">\n\n<br>\nAs the story proceeds, Tannhauser teams up with <b>Greta Lemke</b>, a student of paleoanthropology, and bumps into the enigmatic inventor <b>Lazarus Taft</b>.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_tannhauser.png\">\n\n<br>\n<b>Hans Tannhauser</b> is an American physics student in his mid-twenties – and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read, always curious and of a deeply friendly nature.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_gretchen.png\">\n\n<br>\n<b>Greta Lemke</b> was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trüberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_taft.png\">\n\n<br>\nAs much a reclusive inventor as it gets, <b>Lazarus Taft</b> quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trüberbrook, of all places … What's up with Lazarus Taft?\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/tb_ensemble.png\">\n\n<br>\nTrüberbrook is full of quirky villagers, tourists and strangers – like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni, \"the weird kid\" from Trüberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron, a veteran of two world wars, or Lessing, the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trübi, the legendary lake monster. To name a few.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/handcrafted-scenery.png\">\n\n<br>\nOne of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_1.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nNot the most efficient way of doing things, but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it, though! Look at what we do here, piece by piece, by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_4.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nThe models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_5.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nIt is a lot of work, but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself, how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands, right? Well yes, we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors, they get things done!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_8.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nEvery scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes, no joke.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_6.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nThis way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trüberbrook.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gif_7.jpg\">\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/gameplay.png\">\n\n<br>\nTrüberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative, but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_1.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nYou navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective, usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment, talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_3.jpg\">\n\n<br>\nFor the console versions, we came up with a very intuitive controller input, allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions, you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls, and the controller navigation.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/gameplay_5.jpg\">\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/soundtrack.png\">\n\n<br>\nThe soundtrack of Trüberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game – sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of <i>Tom Waits</i>, <i>Angelo Badalamenti</i>, <i>Mark Lanegan</i>, <i>Timber Timbre</i> or <i>Bohren & der Club of Gore</i>. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/en/localization.png\">\n\n<br>\nWe've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans, we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors: In the international English audio, the main character Tannhauser speaks native American English, while all of the townspeople of Trüberbrook sport genuine German accents!\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/truberbrook_–_a_nerd_saves_the_world/trueberbrook_dcp_2019.jpg\">",

    "Description": "Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a third-person action-adventure with an open world hub. Unlike previous Lego games in which players had to advance through the story in a linear order, players can now choose to start the game from any of the main Skywalker Saga episodes and complete them in any order they wish. Each episode has their own hub filled with planets featured prominently in each respective film that can be visited and explored. Each episode will have five story missions each, a total of 45 levels.\n<br>\n<br>Combat has also been revamped, such as lightsaber fights now involving a variety of combos with light attacks, heavy attacks, and Force moves, and blaster characters having an over-the-shoulder camera angle featured in many third-person shooter games.\n<br>\n<br>Random encounters will also happen in the game's hub. For example, an Imperial Star Destroyer will suddenly jump out of hyperspace and send a fleet of TIE Fighters after the player. Players can choose to engage in dogfights with them or continue onward to progress the story. The game will have more than 200 playable characters, though TT Games has said that number will change.",

When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nYou will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler, heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you've placed.

The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.<h4><b>Tailored sessions with <i>Flexiscope</i></b></h4><img src=\"https://items.gog.com/book_of_demons/flexiscope_optimized.png\" style=\"margin: auto;display: block;\"><br>\n<b>Book of Demons</b> respects your time. It features the <i>Flexiscope</i> engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.<h4><b>Unique Mechanics</b></h4><img src=\"https://items.gog.com/book_of_demons/mechanics_optimized.png\" style=\"margin: auto;display: block;\"><br>\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where <b>Book of Demons</b> differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as <i>monster shields</i>, <i>enemy spells</i>, <i>poison</i>, or <i>knocked cards</i>, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.<h4><b>Hack & Slash in the world of <i>Paperverse</i></b></h4><img src=\"https://items.gog.com/book_of_demons/town_optimized.png\" style=\"margin: auto;display: block;\"><br>\n<b>Book of Demons</b> takes place in <i>Paperverse</i>, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book.\n<br>\nIt’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, <b>Book of Demons</b> is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.<h4><b>Comfort of Gameplay</b></h4><img src=\"https://items.gog.com/book_of_demons/comfort_optimized.png\" style=\"margin: auto;display: block;\"><br>\nMany <b>Book of Demons</b> features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer.

The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.",
